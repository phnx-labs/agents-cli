# Changelog

All notable changes to the Factory extension are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); `scripts/release.sh` requires a
`## [<version>]` section for the version being published.

## [Unreleased]

- **Filter + group-by controls live in the feed header bar next to Save view (RUSH-1526).** The feed's own header (`SavedViews` / `feed-header-bar`) now carries Group + status chips (Needs you / Running / Idle / Failed) + agent-abbr chips, so operators filter and group where they are looking — not only from the top FloorControls bar. Source: `ui/settings/components/mission-control/SavedViewsBar.tsx`, `UnifiedAgentsPane.tsx`, `floor.css`.
- **Floor Group defaults to Outcome (ticket/PR/worktree) instead of Project (RUSH-1479).** Fleet-scale floors collapse agents under the deliverable they serve so the operator sees initiatives, not ~1,100 processes. Source: `ui/settings/components/mission-control/floorModel.ts` (`outcomeLabel`, `FloorGroupBy`), `FloorControls.tsx`, `UnifiedAgentsPane.tsx`.
- **Internal: `foreman.vscode.ts` reuses the shared `humanElapsed` helper (#753).** Deleted the identical private `humanElapsedFromMs` copy and imported the exported `humanElapsed` from `core/foreman.digest.ts`. No behavior change. Source: `apps/factory/src/vscode/foreman.vscode.ts`.
- **Windows device dispatch no longer hardcodes `bash -lc`.** `dispatchToDevice` selects the remote shell from the device registry platform (PowerShell `-EncodedCommand` on windows; bash on POSIX), so Dispatch v2 works on win-mini. Source: `apps/factory/src/core/deviceDispatchShell.ts`, `apps/factory/src/vscode/settings.vscode.ts`. (RUSH-1481)

### Fixed

- **Factory watchdog logs now use the canonical cache path documented by AGENTS.** The
  watchdog bridge, watchdog tick writer, and Factory Floor log reader share one
  `WATCHDOG_LOG_PATH` at `~/.agents/.cache/logs/watchdog.log`, matching the
  post-restructure docs and CLI migration target. (RUSH-1516)
- **Factory Floor cards now use human session names instead of UUID slices (RUSH-1532).**
  Remote sessions preserve explicit labels separately from task topics, and the Floor
  card header prefers label, topic, branch, ticket, and worktree metadata before falling
  back to a generic agent title. Cloud single-agent rows now use their configured name
  or prompt line instead of `agent-019e30a2`-style identifiers.
- **NEEDS YOU precision — finished/stopped agents no longer masquerade as needing
  input (RUSH-1522).** Two gates tightened. (1) `derivePhase` now checks terminal
  statuses first: a `completed`/`stopped`/`failed` agent can no longer be lifted
  into the `waiting` phase by a stale `waitingForInput` flag — it lands in
  DONE/idle/FAILED where it belongs. (2) The prose trailing-"?" waiting heuristic
  now decays: past 30 minutes with no session writes (`PROSE_QUESTION_FRESH_MS`),
  a session that signed off with "anything else?" stops classifying as waiting —
  previously such sessions sat in NEEDS YOU indefinitely (the reported card was 13
  days stale). Structural signals are exempt: a genuinely pending
  `AskUserQuestion`/`ExitPlanMode` still lands in NEEDS YOU at any age. Source:
  `ui/settings/components/mission-control/floorModel.ts` (`derivePhase`),
  `src/core/session.activity.ts` (`detectWaitingForInput`),
  `src/core/remoteSessions.ts` (`enrichWithSessionContent`),
  `src/vscode/terminals.vscode.ts`.

### Added

- **Factory Floor cards now surface plan artifacts for preview (RUSH-1525).**
  Session output, recent worktree files, and attachment refs are scanned for
  `.html` and `ref-*.md` plan files; matching cards show plan chips that open HTML
  plans externally and Markdown plans in the editor preview.
- **Project rollups — one glance answers "what's happening in this project".** The
  rail's Projects flyout rows now carry dim sub-counts (open backlog tickets and
  distinct open PRs) next to the live agent count, and each card in the Projects
  pane gains an activity line — "3 running · 1 waiting · 4 backlog · 2 PRs ·
  active 40m ago" (or "quiet") — all derived in one pass from the live feed and
  backlog the Floor already holds.
- **PR board — every open PR the floor's agents produced, in one actionable list.**
  A new PRs center tab aggregates the live feed's PR URLs and shows, per PR: CI
  state, review decision (approved / changes requested / review required), merge
  conflicts, a chip for the agent that owns it (jumps to its card), and a **Merge**
  button that appears only when the PR is open, not draft, approved, CI-green, and
  conflict-free. Rows are ranked for action: ready-to-merge first, then red CI /
  conflicts, then changes-requested. Merge runs plain `gh pr merge --rebase` (never
  `--admin` — branch protection stays in force); refusals surface inline on the row.
- **Recap — a work ledger for "what happened while I was away".** A new Recap center
  (clock button on the rail, Recap tab in the strip) lists finished sessions across the
  whole fleet, grouped by day, each with its task line, project · host · branch, ticket,
  a PR link, and the session's real duration and cost. Day headers roll up sessions,
  spend, and PRs (e.g. "Today — 12 sessions · $18.40 · 3 PRs"). No new bookkeeping: the
  CLI's `agents sessions` metrics (`durationMs`, `costUsd`, `tokenCount`) were already
  computed per session and are now carried through instead of dropped. Live sessions are
  excluded — the feed owns what's running, the ledger owns what finished.
- **The backlog now shows who is already working each ticket.** A ticket an agent
  carries gets an in-flight chip on its row (phase dot + agent abbr, `+N` when several
  are on it; hover for the full roster), and the ticket detail pane gains an **In
  flight** section — one row per worker with phase, host, and PR, each jumping to that
  agent's card. Dispatching onto a ticket that's already in flight is guarded: the
  button turns amber, reads "Dispatch anyway", and names the agent already on it, so a
  second agent is a deliberate choice instead of an accident.

### Changed

- **Plan-watch now reads from the CLI's canonical `session.plan` field instead of re-parsing
  raw JSONL.** `watchForPlan` previously read the session `.jsonl` file and re-implemented the
  `ExitPlanMode` scanner (`parsePlanFromClaudeJsonl`) — a duplicate of the CLI's session state
  engine. The CLI now carries `plan` on `SessionMeta` (surfaced via `agents sessions <id>
  --json`), so the extension polls the CLI directly and `parsePlanFromClaudeJsonl` is deleted.
  No behavior change for the Floor's plan-ready surface. (RUSH-1505)

- **The collapsed Floor rail's Projects and Hosts buttons are now flyout menus instead of
  three buttons that all expanded the sidebar.** Click Projects for the curated project
  list (live agent count + amber waiting count per project, plus any uncurated project
  that has agents running) and jump straight to that scope; click Hosts for the fleet
  roster with health dots and per-host counts. The Hosts button carries a red dot whenever
  any host is offline, a lime **Dispatch** button now sits at the top of the rail, and the
  `»` chevron is the single expand affordance. Active states are fixed across the board
  (Backlog lights when the backlog center is showing; a project/host scope lights its
  button), and the rail-vs-sidebar choice is remembered across reloads.

### Fixed

- **"Needs you" in the rail and sidebar now actually filters the feed.** It used to clear
  all filters — identical to "All agents" — despite the amber badge. It now toggles the
  same `needs` status chip the controls bar drives, and "All agents" clears it.

## [0.9.291] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **NEEDS-YOU cards no longer show a doubled, contextless "Thinking…".** A paused/idle
  card rendered the live-activity fallback string `"Thinking..."` twice — once as the card
  body and again as the green now-line — because `resp` fell back to the live-activity
  string when the agent had no last message. `resp` is now strictly the agent's last real
  message (empty when there is none), and the now-line renders only while an agent is
  actively working (`running`/`stalled`), so a paused card that's waiting on you shows just
  its task, progress timeline, and reply box.

### Added

- **The NEEDS-YOU detail panel now shows why an agent is blocked, the task, and the real
  question with one-click answers.** A blocked card used to surface only a status word and
  a "Thinking…" line — you had to open the terminal to find out what it wanted. The
  decision block at the top of the right pane now renders a **why-blocked chip** (Question
  / Plan review / Permission — permission in red), the **original task** for context, and
  the **real question with its option chips**, sourced from the CLI's structured decision
  (`sessions --json` `question`) rather than a regex over prose. Extracted into
  `<AgentDecision>` so the preview harness renders the exact markup (`?view=decision`).
  (RUSH-1521, RUSH-1546)
- **Inline approve/deny for interactive prompts.** When an option maps to a select-list
  keystroke — a permission prompt (Approve=`1` / Deny=`esc`), a plan review, or an
  `AskUserQuestion` — clicking it now sends that **keystroke** through the existing
  terminal/tmux reply rail (the proven Ink text-then-CR and `tmux send-keys` paths)
  instead of a label the TUI would ignore, so you can unblock without opening the
  terminal. Cloud/team replies stay label-based (semantic-message APIs). (RUSH-453)

### Fixed

- **Cloud status + latest-activity now render identically across hosts.** The Electron app
  and the VS Code extension carried two divergent `mapCloudStatus` tables — the extension
  missed `error` / `in_progress` / `queued` and matched case-sensitively, the app missed
  `allocating` / `needs_review` — so the same cloud run could show a different status per
  host. Both now import one shared `mapCloudStatus` (`src/core/cloudStatus.ts`) whose
  case-insensitive switch is the union of the two tables. The standalone app's
  "latest activity" also sorted ISO timestamps lexically (wrong on mixed offsets); it now
  compares on `Date.getTime()`, matching the extension. (RUSH-1512)
- **The standalone Factory app now pauses its floor poll when the floor is hidden.** The
  Electron host handled `subscribeFloor` but dropped `unsubscribeFloor`, so its 5s poll —
  which shells out to read agent state and hit the cloud-runs API — kept running even when
  no floor was visible. It now stops on `unsubscribeFloor` and resumes on `subscribeFloor`,
  mirroring the VS Code host's `cleanupFloorWatchers` lifecycle. (RUSH-1509)

## [0.9.290] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Structured questions render on the card** — when an agent calls `AskUserQuestion`,
  the question text and its option labels now surface on the NEEDS-YOU card as clickable
  reply buttons. The data lived in the tool-call input all along; the card only read the
  agent's prose, so the question was invisible. Clicking an option delivers the answer
  back to the agent over its existing reply channel (terminal / tmux / cloud / team).
  (RUSH-453, RUSH-1521)

### Changed

- **Terminal detail pane now matches the headless/cloud panes** — the flat "Recent tools"
  list is replaced by the vertical progress timeline (oldest → now) plus a streaming
  "Latest" message rendered as markdown, so every agent's detail pane reads identically.
  Recent files span the full width. (RUSH-1519, RUSH-1546)

## [0.9.289] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **0.9.288 failed to activate** — it was packaged without `node_modules`, so the
  extension host threw on `require()` of runtime deps (`ws`, `yaml`, MCP SDK, …) and
  no commands registered (`command 'agents.configure' not found`). Repackaged with
  dependencies included. The 0.9.288 card redesign is unchanged; this only restores
  the shipped dependencies.

## [0.9.288] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Readable agent cards on the Factory Floor.** Cards now lead with the agent's
  original **task** (not its last message), render **markdown** in message bodies,
  add a live **progress timeline** of recent tool calls plus a **streaming activity
  feed** of the agent's messages, keep the **todo checklist** from silently
  vanishing, and show a clean **worktree chip** instead of a raw `WT=/…/path`. The
  detail pane is reordered for legibility: Task → Progress timeline → Todos →
  Activity → PR/CI.

### Fixed

- **Shell (`SH`) tabs now load your full interactive shell environment.** Every
  tracked terminal — agent CLIs *and* bare shell tabs — carries `AGENT_TERMINAL_ID`,
  which rc files commonly use to take a minimal fast-path (skip oh-my-zsh, themes,
  plugins) for agent terminals no human types in. That mis-fired on the `SH` tab,
  which *is* an interactive shell you drive: it came up with a bare prompt, no theme,
  and missing aliases/tools. Factory now also exports **`AGENT_TERMINAL_KIND`**
  (`shell` for a bare shell tab, `agent` for an agent CLI terminal) so your rc file
  can tell them apart. Gate your fast-path on it, e.g. `zsh`:
  `if [[ -n "$AGENT_TERMINAL_ID" && "$AGENT_TERMINAL_KIND" != "shell" ]]; then …`.

## [0.9.286] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Factory Floor redesign — matches the approved prototype.** A cohesive pass over
  the whole dashboard:
  - **Icon rail** — compact left nav of icon buttons with count/needs badges
    (Agents · Needs · Backlog · Projects · Hosts); expands to the full text sidebar.
  - **Proper sub-tab strip** — the Floor's views (Agents / Backlog / Projects / Hosts)
    are now first-class tabs with count/needs badges, active-lime; Dispatch lives on the
    strip.
  - **One contextual controls bar** — the Group/Sort/filter controls swap to the active
    tab's set (agents Group/Sort vs backlog Group/Sort/LN/GH), so there's no more
    duplicated control bar. The old cluttered Status/Agent chip strip is gone — filtering
    lives in saved views + search.
  - **Double-click a task → its own closeable tab** — opens the full detail (rendered
    markdown, comments, images) with Dispatch right there; multiple task tabs at once.
  - **Human session labels** (`terminal-race-fix`, not `claude-596c4c07`) + a compact
    `<agent>·<id>` provenance chip; **project-link group headers** (`N agents` + Linear
    project pill).
  - **Detail-pane artifacts row** — the selected agent's PR / CI / spawned-team / created
    tickets as color-coded chips.
  - **Foreman corner FAB** — the voice orb is smaller and tucked into the corner.
  - **Grouped by project by default**, **checklist expanded by default** with the current
    step highlighted, **one-click PR link**, **created-ticket / spawned-team chips** on
    cards (backed by session scanning).

### Fixed

- **Markdown now renders in the ticket/task detail** instead of showing raw `##` /
  code-fences / `**bold**` (reuses the shared `renderTodoDescription` renderer).

## [0.9.284] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Factory Floor redesign — the card now shows the agent's outputs at a glance.**
  A cohesive pass over the live feed:
  - **Checklist expanded by default** on each card (still collapsible), with the
    current step highlighted so progress reads without a click.
  - **Feed grouped by project by default** (NEEDS YOU stays pinned above the groups).
  - **One-click PR link** — the `PR #N` pill is now a real link to the pull request.
  - **One unified search** — the TopBar center is the single live-feed filter; the
    duplicate search box in the Floor controls bar is gone (⌘K still opens the palette).
  - **Artifact chips** — cards surface the tracker refs the agent *created* (Linear
    `create_issue` / `gh issue create`) and any team it *spawned* (`agents teams
    create/add`), distinct from the injected/worked-on ticket. Backed by new session
    scanning (`createdTickets` / `spawnedTeam` on both the indexed scan and live
    session state).

### Fixed

- **Editor "Send to Agent" (slash-command + keyboard shortcut) silently did nothing.** The markdown editor webview may call VS Code's one-shot `acquireVsCodeApi()` only once per load, but `App.tsx` consumed it at startup while the Tiptap `KeyboardShortcuts` (`Mod-Shift-a` / `Mod-Shift-i`) and `SlashCommands` ("Send to Agent" / "Ask Agent") extensions each re-called `acquireVsCodeApi()` on use — a second acquisition that throws / yields `undefined`, so their `if (vscode)` guard fell through and the `postMessage` never fired. All four call sites plus `App.tsx` now share a single cached handle via a new `ui/editor/vscodeApi.ts` (`getVsCodeApi()`), acquired at most once. Regression test (`vscodeApi.test.ts`) simulates the single-acquire contract. Source: `apps/factory/ui/editor/vscodeApi.ts`, `App.tsx`, `extensions/KeyboardShortcuts.ts`, `extensions/SlashCommands.ts`.

## [0.9.283] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **GitHub links pointed at a retired repo.** `package.json` `repository`, the
  settings "Open GitHub" action, and the Guide tab's "Learn More" link now all point
  to `github.com/phnx-labs/agents-cli` (`apps/factory`). Publish identity — publisher
  `swarmify`, name `swarm-ext`, appId — is unchanged.
- **Factory Floor feed showed identical, contextless cards for co-located sessions.**
  Ported the swarmify/extension feed fixes: fan-out remote-session enrichment now
  attributes each row to the correct device (`machine`), surfaces the worktree slug,
  live preview, structured ticket id, and real branch, and caches `startedAtMs` by
  PID so a terminal's start time no longer drifts to `Date.now()` on every republish.
  Consolidated the duplicated feed model into a single `@shared` implementation with
  a `MISSING_EXPORT` build-time drift guard.

### Added

- **tmux terminals by default** (`agents.terminalMode: auto | tmux | native`) with each
  agent terminal publishing its tmux pane (`%N`) and editor-tab index, surfaced as the
  pane handle and "viewing in <tab>" on Factory Floor cards. Gives same-cwd agents
  distinct, addressable identities.
- **tmux pane border now shows the live session label.** The border was seeded once with
  the bare agent code (e.g. `0: CC`) and never updated. It now tracks the same auto-label
  as the editor tab — the moment the session topic resolves (auto-label poller / focus
  fetch / manual rename), the border re-renders to `0: CC - <topic>` on the shared socket,
  even when the terminal isn't focused. This matters most when a session is reattached
  from a plain terminal outside the editor, where the border is the only label surface.
