## [0.9.283] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **Factory Floor feed showed identical, contextless cards for co-located sessions.**
  Ported the swarmify/extension feed fixes: fan-out remote-session enrichment now
  attributes each row to the correct device (`machine`), surfaces the worktree slug,
  live preview, structured ticket id, and real branch, and caches `startedAtMs` by
  PID so a terminal's start time no longer drifts to `Date.now()` on every republish.
  Consolidated the duplicated feed model into a single `@shared` implementation with
  a `MISSING_EXPORT` build-time drift guard.

### Added

- **tmux terminals by default** (`agents.terminalMode: auto | tmux | native`) with each
  agent terminal publishing its tmux pane (`%N`) and editor-tab index, surfaced as the
  pane handle and "viewing in <tab>" on Factory Floor cards. Gives same-cwd agents
  distinct, addressable identities.
