## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Editor "Send to Agent" (slash-command + keyboard shortcut) silently did nothing.** The markdown editor webview may call VS Code's one-shot `acquireVsCodeApi()` only once per load, but `App.tsx` consumed it at startup while the Tiptap `KeyboardShortcuts` (`Mod-Shift-a` / `Mod-Shift-i`) and `SlashCommands` ("Send to Agent" / "Ask Agent") extensions each re-called `acquireVsCodeApi()` on use — a second acquisition that throws / yields `undefined`, so their `if (vscode)` guard fell through and the `postMessage` never fired. All four call sites plus `App.tsx` now share a single cached handle via a new `ui/editor/vscodeApi.ts` (`getVsCodeApi()`), acquired at most once. Regression test (`vscodeApi.test.ts`) simulates the single-acquire contract. Source: `apps/factory/ui/editor/vscodeApi.ts`, `App.tsx`, `extensions/KeyboardShortcuts.ts`, `extensions/SlashCommands.ts`.

## [0.9.283] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **GitHub links pointed at a retired repo.** `package.json` `repository`, the
  settings "Open GitHub" action, and the Guide tab's "Learn More" link now all point
  to `github.com/phnx-labs/agents-cli` (`apps/factory`). Publish identity — publisher
  `swarmify`, name `swarm-ext`, appId — is unchanged.
- **Factory Floor feed showed identical, contextless cards for co-located sessions.**
  Ported the swarmify/extension feed fixes: fan-out remote-session enrichment now
  attributes each row to the correct device (`machine`), surfaces the worktree slug,
  live preview, structured ticket id, and real branch, and caches `startedAtMs` by
  PID so a terminal's start time no longer drifts to `Date.now()` on every republish.
  Consolidated the duplicated feed model into a single `@shared` implementation with
  a `MISSING_EXPORT` build-time drift guard.

### Added

- **tmux terminals by default** (`agents.terminalMode: auto | tmux | native`) with each
  agent terminal publishing its tmux pane (`%N`) and editor-tab index, surfaced as the
  pane handle and "viewing in <tab>" on Factory Floor cards. Gives same-cwd agents
  distinct, addressable identities.
- **tmux pane border now shows the live session label.** The border was seeded once with
  the bare agent code (e.g. `0: CC`) and never updated. It now tracks the same auto-label
  as the editor tab — the moment the session topic resolves (auto-label poller / focus
  fetch / manual rename), the border re-renders to `0: CC - <topic>` on the shared socket,
  even when the terminal isn't focused. This matters most when a session is reattached
  from a plain terminal outside the editor, where the border is the only label surface.
