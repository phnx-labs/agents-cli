# Agents Extension

VS Code extension for multi-agent coding. Spawns AI terminals (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, OpenCode) as editor tabs with keyboard shortcuts, and dispatches work to Rush Cloud.

This file is a **map**, not the territory. Keep it a short paragraph per area plus pointers. Read the actual code for current details.

## Layout

```
/src/core       Pure functions (no VS Code dependencies; unit-tested here)
/src/vscode     VS Code integration (commands, webviews, terminal tracking)
/ui/settings    Dashboard webview (React + Vite) — includes Factory Floor
/ui/editor      Custom markdown editor components
/assets         Icons (agent logos, rush bird, etc.)
/tests          Real-service tests (no mocks)
```

## Testing the Factory Floor UI

The Factory Floor feed + Dispatch panel are a React webview (`ui/settings`, top component `UnifiedAgentsPane.tsx`). To SEE and verify UI changes, do NOT install the packaged `.vsix` and drive VS Code via accessibility automation (`osascript` / `agents computer`) to open the dashboard — that steals your focus and is slow. Use the committed preview harness, which renders the real components with representative data in a plain browser page you can screenshot:

```
cd apps/factory/ui && bun run dev
# open http://localhost:5173/settings/preview/?view=feed   (or ?view=dispatch)
#   add &theme=dark  or  &theme=light
```

`ui/settings/preview/preview.tsx` mounts the same feed + DispatchPanel the webview uses; it is excluded from the shipped bundle (`vite.settings.config.ts` only inputs `settings/index.html`). Screenshot the browser page and actually inspect the render against the intent.

Gotchas:
- A built `preview-dist/index.html` opened over `file://` renders BLANK (Chromium CORS-blocks ES-module `<script src>` over file://). Serve over http (`bun run dev`), or inline the built JS/CSS into one self-contained HTML.
- To screenshot a browser window on another macOS Space, `screencapture -o` grabs the wrong Space; use a window-targeted capture (e.g. `agents computer screenshot --bundle <id> --window-id <id>`), which is focus-safe.

For logic-only changes, `bun test` in `apps/factory/` runs the `mission-control/*.test.ts` suites (floorModel, floorAdapter, dispatch, savedViews, etc.).

## Building + Testing

```bash
bun run compile   # tsc + vite build for both webviews
bun test          # Full test suite, no mocks
bash scripts/install.sh <version>   # Package .vsix and install to Cursor + Code + Codium
```

| Factory Floor (dashboard, dispatch) | `ui/settings/components/mission-control/` |
| Cloud dispatch resolver (label parsing, repo/owner) | `ui/settings/components/mission-control/dispatch.ts` + `src/vscode/settings.vscode.ts` (`case 'dispatchTask'`) |
| Foreman voice orb (OpenAI Realtime, mic + speaker pipeline) | `src/vscode/foreman.audio.ts` (audio I/O via ffmpeg/ffplay, mic-gated during TTS to prevent echo loop), `src/vscode/foreman.vscode.ts` (session + tools), `ui/settings/components/foreman/ForemanOrb.tsx` (UI) |

## Keybindings

The canonical list is `package.json` → `contributes.keybindings`. Read it there; don't let this doc drift.

## Non-obvious gotchas worth knowing before you edit

Terminal tracking spans two worlds (VS Code API + an internal map that can go stale across restarts) — always cross-check `vscode.window.terminals` when reconciling. Three name formats for agent types live in different layers (UI/config/prefix); `src/core/utils.ts` is the reference. Webviews need `retainContextWhenHidden: true` or they reload on focus loss. `vscode.Terminal.iconPath` and `name` are frozen at `createTerminal()` time — there is no setter, which is why shell-adoption swaps the internal `agentConfig` but the tab chip keeps reading `SH`. Every spawned terminal carries `AGENT_TERMINAL_ID` (the extension reads it back from `creationOptions.env` to identify the tab), so it can't distinguish an agent CLI from a user shell — `buildAgentTerminalEnv` (`src/core/terminals.ts`) also exports `AGENT_TERMINAL_KIND` (`agent` | `shell`) for exactly that: a user's rc file gates its agent fast-path on `KIND != shell` so a bare `SH` tab still loads its full interactive env. Pass `{ kind: 'shell' }` for shell tabs. Beyond that, read the code — the mechanics change faster than this file should.
